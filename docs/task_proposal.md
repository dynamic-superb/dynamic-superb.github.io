# Task Proposal Guidelines

Before initiating data uploads to Huggingface or creating pull requests, contributors must submit their task proposals through [GitHub issues](https://github.com/dynamic-superb/dynamic-superb/issues) 📝. This initial phase is crucial for maintaining quality while minimizing unnecessary interventions. The review process will focus on ensuring that all submissions include the necessary information across several key areas:

1. **Task Formulation** 🎯: Ensure the task is both reasonable and solvable. For instance, consider if using a podcast recording could accurately predict its audience size (probably not feasible). Additionally, the task should be unique. For instance, if a language identification (LID) task is already part of the benchmark, proposing another LID task requires justification for its distinction. For example, the new task could focus on a dataset featuring spontaneous speech or code-switched utterances, clearly differentiating it from the existing one.
2. **Task Description** ✍️: Contributors must provide a concise description of the task, highlighting its significance and rationale. Understanding the task's importance and potential impact is crucial.
3. **Dataset & License** 📊: Given the challenges associated with independently collecting speech/audio datasets, many contributors resort to existing datasets. It is important to verify that the chosen dataset is accompanied by a proper license, permitting remixing and redistribution. Proposals lacking this essential information must not progress to the subsequent phase.
4. **Instruction Examples** 📃: While it's not mandatory to include a comprehensive set of instructions, contributors should present some samples (at least two). This allows for the evaluation of whether the instructions are aligned with the proposed task.
5. **Avoidance of Duplication** 🚫: To foster innovation, contributors are encouraged to propose new tasks rather than using different datasets for existing tasks. Proposals for tasks that have already been proposed should be declined unless it clearly outlines a significant distinction from existing tasks. However, multiple evaluation datasets under a single task proposal are permissible.
6. **Bias & Fairness** ⚖️: It is essential that tasks do not propagate or encourage racism, sexism, or any form of discrimination. While tasks like racism or sexism detection are sensitive and may be vital, they require thorough discussion in the bi-weekly SUPERB meeting to ensure proper context and implementation. Additionally, it's crucial to acknowledge that biases can also stem from the datasets used. Contributors are thus encouraged (but not necessarily) to include basic statistics about their datasets to identify and mitigate potential biases.
